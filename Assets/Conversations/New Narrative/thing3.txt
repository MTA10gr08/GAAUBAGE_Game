	You walk nervously down the corridor to Jeremiah’s office. You are not sure why, but he requested a meeting with you today.
	You find the door to his office and knock.
Jeremiah	Yes! Come in.
	You walk inside the office and Jeremiah stands there with his back towards you, looking over the smog-filled streets of SwayzCity. He makes a gesture that indicates you should sit down. You do so.
Jeremiah	It is not often in my life that I have felt proud.
Jeremiah	When you first sat in that spotter booth, I knew I saw fire in your eyes. A passion. And with my guidance, you have become a decent operator.
	He turns and looks at you.
Jeremiah	I am a fantastic supervisor.
	He sits back down in his office chair
Jeremiah	The higher-ups are saying we are picking up too many contaminants.
[You]	Sorry?
Jeremiah	You know, dirt, leaves that sort of thing. They want the department to be more precise when handling Spotters.
[You]	Did you call me here to tell me that?
Jeremiah	Well, it seems rather unfair that I have to come to you all the time, doesn’t it?
Jeremiah	You should get going, I have meetings with all the other operators in the department.
	You get up and notice Jeremiah getting back into position by the window overlooking the city.
	You walk back to your booth.
[You]	… And that’s what he said
AI	Jeremiah is a confusing person.
[You]	Tell me about it.
AI	Jeremiah is a confusing person because of his strange mannerisms and—
[You]	No no, it’s an expression.
AI	You are confusing too.
[You]	Either way, we need to limit the amount of contaminants you pick up with the spotters. What would such a task look like?
AI	I would need exact knowledge of what is and is not the same object. I can make a task for segmenting objects. This should increase accuracy.
[You]	Alright, sounds good.
