Jeremiah	Superstar!
	*You quickly scramble to look like you are actively working*
[You]	Jeremiah, uhm hi?
Jeremiah	You know kid, it is rare we see someone with as much enthusiasm as you, you’ve really started doing numbers!
[You]	Wow really? Thanks, I—
Jeremiah	Too bad it’s all wrong.
Jeremiah	Yeah see, you’ve got numbers, but—and you really should have caught this on your own. You can’t just throw what you collect into the same pile.
	*You throw a quick, angry glance at your screens, immediately feeling a little dumb as there isn’t really anyone to scowl at*
Jeremiah	I mean, the chart is there for a reason.
	*Jeremiah slaps a poster in your booth with a big confusing chart of different types of plastics*
Jeremiah	You are lucky your numbers are exceptional, but you gotta pull your own load around here. You have to sort your findings.
Jeremiah	Oh look at the time, it’s my lunch break, take care!
[You]	You heard all that right?
AI	Yes.
[You]	How could you just throw it all in one pile!? Although I might be a bit to blame, I should have seen this coming by now.
AI	Objects are confusing, shape, colour, material, and weight, all are different yet some are the same.
[You]	Could you set up another task? Something that could help you categorize each piece of litter?
AI	Yes. This should be possible.
[You]	JunkCorp should have some data on how they sort their items, you can probably use that as a starting point for categories.
AI	Understood.
AI	…
AI	The task should be ready.
[You]	Alright, I’ll get to it.
